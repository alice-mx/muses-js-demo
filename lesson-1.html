  <h1>Lesson 1 - HTML</h1>
  <h2>This is a page</h2>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page. HTML is a 'markup language' that you can use to create the building blocks of a
    webpage. You can view the page in a web browser, like Chrome or Edge. To edit the page, open
    this file with a text editor like Notepad. It might be easier to use a text editor which is specifically for coding,
    like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>, as this will highlight parts of the code and make it easier
    to read.</p>
  <p>HTML pages are made up of elements, such as h1 (heading 1), "p" (paragraph) and "div" (division).</p>
  <h3>Element can be within other elements
    <ul>
      <li>Like this list.</li>
      <li>Of items.</li>
    </ul>
  </h3>
  <label>You can make labels: </label><input type="text"
    value="And Input Fields"></input>

  <button>And Buttons</button>
  <strong>You need additional languages like CSS and JavaScript to add style and interactivity to web pages.</strong>
