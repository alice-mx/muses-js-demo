  <h1>Lesson 4 - JavaScript</h1>
  <div class="info">
    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    JavaScript is a language that can be used to dynamically change HTML elements. This makes webpages more
    interactive and useful.

    <h4>Page Structure</h4>
    In these modules, we've put the JavaScript after the HTML content in &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags.
    Sometimes JavaScript will be in another file that's imported when the page loads.

    <h4>The Command Line</h4>
    When programming in JavaScript, it is useful to view output in the 'console' tab of the developer window (Fn+F12
    to view)

    <h4> Comments</h4>
    A comment is a part of the code that doesn't do anything. They start with // or /* characters.
    They don't change what the code does, but can be useful for putting human readable notes in the code.

  </div>
  <div class="dotted-div">
    <h2>Task 1: Hello World</h2>
    <p>
      Update the JavaScript at the bottom of the page so that the alert reads "Hello World" rather than "This alert is
      written in JavaScript!"
    </p>
    <p>Refresh the page to see your changes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="key-takeaways">
