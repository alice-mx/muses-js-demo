  <h1>Lesson 3 - JavaScript</h1>
  <div class="info">
    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a language that can be used to dynamically change HTML elements. This makes webpages more
      interactive and useful.</p>
    <h4>Page Structure</h4>
    <p>In these modules, we've put the JavaScript after the HTML content in &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags.

      <h4>The Command Line</h4>
      <p>
        When programming in JavaScript, it is useful to view output in the 'console' tab of the developer window (Fn+F12
        to
        view)
      </p>
      <h4> Comments</h4>
      A comment is a part of the code that doesn't do anything. They start with // or /* characters.
      They don't change what the code does, but can be useful for putting human readable notes in the code.
  </div>
  <div class="dotted-div">
    <h2>Task 1: Hello World</h2>
    <p>Update the JavaScript at the bottom of the page so that the alert reads "Hello World" rather than "This alert is
      written in JavaScript!"</p>
    <p>Refresh the page to see your changes.</p>
  </div>
