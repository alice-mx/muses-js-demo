  <h1>What's next?</h1>
  <p>This concludes the lesson modules.
    If you'd like to try applying some of these lessons to more advanced examples, we have two incomplete games that you
    can develop.</p>
  <p>Unlike the modules, these don't have specific takeaways, and there is more than one way to achieve the requested
    objectives.</p>
  <p>You will have to use a combination of the skills you've learned throughout the workshop to finish the games.</p>
